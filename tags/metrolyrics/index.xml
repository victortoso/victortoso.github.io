      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last post just after GUADEC. I&amp;rsquo;ve lost some time in August due moving to a new place in Campinas with two friends of mine. It was three weeks ago and I&amp;rsquo;m still feeling tired (I&amp;rsquo;m taking some time to get used with this new place).
Since then, I&amp;rsquo;m working on grilo-plugins and this post is all about what I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished and what are the next steps after GSoC.</description>

      <description>Oh boy, there are things that can slow you down. It&amp;rsquo;s been three weeks since my last post, in this short period of time I had a car accident ( I&amp;rsquo;m 100% alright! ), one root canal treatment (with a good dose of pain), my girlfriend moved to another city&amp;hellip; Oh well, too many headaches in three weeks!
But when I was in good mood (or healthy enough) here I was, in front of this screen trying to make good code to Grilo&amp;hellip; and I like the achievements so far.</description>

      <description>First of all, as a good beginner in blogging I have promised that
I&#39;ll make a proper introducing of the project later this week  which I did not. Sorry for that. I hope to do it soon.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying Lua since last weekend with the good guidance of the Programming in Lua (written by Roberto Ierusalimschy as a way to improve my lua skills. Actually, before starting reading this book I thought my knowledge of lua was _[ok]() because it is easy to understand and make some code.</description>
