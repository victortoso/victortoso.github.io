      <description>Since the end of the Google Summer of Code 2014 so many things have happened that It is really hard to make a simple blog post about it&amp;hellip; but I must try :)
New job Well, along with the GSoC I&amp;rsquo;ve applied to a job at Red Hat and the process ended in August. Since October 15th I am part of the Spice team and I will be working at the Brno office in Czech Republic.</description>
