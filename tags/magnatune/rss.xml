                <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;gom&quot;&gt;gom&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the work I&#x27;ve being doing since last report is improving the
TVDB source in Grilo Plugins in order to have a cache for all data that
you have once downloaded from thetvdb.com.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m doing that with gom.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I thought it was a bit complicated as creating sql queries
directly is easier. But under the hood gom does a lot of useful things
that you don&#x27;t even need to bother thinking. It is good to see that &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audidude.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;12&#x2F;gom.html&quot;&gt;it
was moved&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to
git.gnome.org.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, It was really good to see &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;magnatune.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Magnatune&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
working when I was reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sai-prayaga.rhcloud.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;05&#x2F;grilo-plugins-and-ampache&#x2F;&quot;&gt;last
post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
from Sai. It was my first patch to GNOME :). I&#x27;m thinking about updating
the Magnatune source with gom in the near future and probably with more
features. Let&#x27;s see!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: One could check the thetvdb source patches
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.gnome.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=672933&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;next&quot;&gt;Next&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration with GNOME Videos! I&#x27;m excited to see this working :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;guadec&quot;&gt;Guadec&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah! I loved last year conference and I wouldn&#x27;t miss this year.
Thanks very much to the GNOME Foundation for helping out with the
sponsorship.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;1405-01-gnome-sponsored-badge.png&quot; alt=&quot;GNOME rocks!&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Magnatune upstream and GSoC</title>
                <pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was having a busy week until this Sunday which happened to be my
birthday!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just made 25 years old and the celebration with my family was
remarkable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m just happy with such great family.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But besides my family, two amazing things made this last three days
quite unforgettable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, my first code to an open source community reached the upstream!
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.igalia.com&#x2F;jasuarez&#x2F;2013&#x2F;05&#x2F;25&#x2F;grilo-plugins-0-2-8-released&#x2F;&quot;&gt;As posted by
Juan&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
within the 0.2.8 release of grilo-plugins is included the Magnatune
plugin.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m really glad about it! Thanks to
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.gnome.org&#x2F;JuanSuarez&quot;&gt;Juan&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.gnome.org&#x2F;BastienNocera&quot;&gt;Bastien&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for all suggestions and
for reviewing the patches!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I was accepted at Google Summer of Code program to keep working
with grilo! I&#x27;ll make a proper introducing of the project later this
week but the reader can have an idea at the abstract page.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnome.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;GNOME&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and Google for it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot is happening and I&#x27;m full of good expectations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Time goes by when you finally finish your 18 years studying things that
people said you need to learn. Finally you start doing more and more
things that you want to do. Learning what you think is interesting and
working with what you love.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m entering in a new phase of my life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been working in a few projects that made most of my days goes by in
a blink of an eye. Which is something that would make most of us really
happy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was recently that I felt a different kind of happiness with my
work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was studying how &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;live.gnome.org&#x2F;Grilo&quot;&gt;Grilo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; works to use it
in small project of mine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of curiosity, I began to have more interest in how exactly Grilo
works and the features that were expected to its future. It was about
time to
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google-melange.com&#x2F;gsoc&#x2F;homepage&#x2F;google&#x2F;gsoc2013&quot;&gt;GSoC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
period start and I felt quite comfortable at seeking guidance with Grilo
developers to share my will to help.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little more than a month since my first contact with the community and
I&#x27;m still trying to make some code reach upstream &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.gnome.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=698523&quot;&gt;a
plugin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; but... what
amazing experience this has been!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#x27;t know Magnatune until Juan introducing it to me. It&#x27;s really
nice (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;magnatune.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;check it out&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if some audio players have already a good Magnatune plugin (like
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.gnome.org&#x2F;Apps&#x2F;Rhythmbox&quot;&gt;Rhythmbox&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), the plugin I&#x27;m
working on could be useful for others applications that may be
integrated with Grilo.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeling of usefulness that I rarely felt with others projects I have
worked, I found after this time I&#x27;ve spent with Grilo.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m really excited with all this. I&#x27;m learning a lot and I truly believe
that I can help a lot more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step by step, giving back to the community what I&#x27;ve been using for so
many years!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
