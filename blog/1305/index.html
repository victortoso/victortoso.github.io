<p>Oh boy, there are things that can slow you down. It&rsquo;s been three weeks
since my last post, in this short period of time I had a car accident (
I&rsquo;m 100% alright! ), one root canal treatment (with a good dose of
pain), my girlfriend moved to another city&hellip; Oh well, too many
headaches in three weeks!</p>

<p>But when I was in good mood (or healthy enough) here I was, in front of
this screen trying to make good code to Grilo&hellip; and I like the
achievements so far. Lets take a look.</p>

<p>I started to implement the <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/">Metrolyrics</a>
plugin before writing any C code to Grilo in order to have a lua-based
plugin to use. A lot of this plugin has changed to work with
lua-factory. For those who <a href="http://www.victortoso.com/planet-gsoc-project-and-brazil.html">don&rsquo;t
remember</a>,
lua-factory is part of grilo-plugins, and it is the glue-code in charge
to load-and-use the lua-plugins.</p>

<p>In this moment, we can use the <em>Search</em>, <em>Browse</em>, <em>Query</em> and <em>Resolve</em>
operations from Grilo to this lua-plugin.</p>

<p>As the lua code needs some help from C to perform a few operations,
lua-library was created to be a module to lua. This module has two
functions implemented: Fetch, to perform async fetch from web and
Callback, to return the content to the application.</p>

<p>A lot has to be done yet. Hopefully without any personal headache :)</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Store</em> and <em>Remove</em> operations must be implemented in lua-factory;</li>
<li>Log and Error functions to the lua-library;</li>
<li>Better care with user configs, metadata-keys</li>
<li>Solving some problems with UTF-8 chars</li>
</ul>

<p>I will be writing a new lua-plugin this week and I&rsquo;m trying to choose
between <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">Soundcloud</a> or
<a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a>. Both have the necessary features to be
implemented that Metrolyrics lacks for Grilo.</p>

<p>Well, I intend to make my next post in Brno before GUADEC and another
post after with much more GNOMExperience&hellip;</p>
