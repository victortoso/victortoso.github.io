<p>It&rsquo;s been almost one year since my last blog post. One year since I got
married and left Brazil to live in Czech Republic. In my <a href="http://www.victortoso.com/hello-new-life.html">last
post</a> I talked about all
the changes I was passing through but no change is bigger than having a
baby. <a href="https://twitter.com/victortoso/status/647374843038539776">Tereza</a>
has almost 4 months now :)</p>

<p>One year at <a href="http://www.redhat.com/en">Red Hat</a> and
<a href="http://www.spice-space.org/">Spice</a>.</p>

<p>Even with the great amount of things to do in personal and professional
life, I want to keep making GNOME better as much as I can in my free
time and thus I want to get back to blogging again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve finally managed to migrate from Blogger to
<a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/index.html">Pelican</a> so I hope
that more personal posts like this one will not be part of Planet GNOME
in the future :)</p>

<p>I also plan to blog more about personal stuff such as being a father or
living abroad. I hope that it can ease the distance from family and
friends in Brazil.</p>

<p>This one year was just crazy. Time flies and nothing like raising a
child to realize that.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
