<p>First of all, as a good beginner in blogging I have promised that</p>

<pre><code>I'll make a proper introducing of the project later this week
</code></pre>

<p>which I did not. Sorry for that. I hope to do it soon.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying Lua since last weekend with the good guidance of the
<a href="http://www.lua.org/pil/">Programming in Lua</a> (written by <a href="http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/">Roberto
Ierusalimschy</a> as a way to improve
my lua skills. Actually, before starting reading this book I thought my
knowledge of lua was _[ok]() because it is easy to understand and make
some code. Naive!</p>

<p>Lua is simple but we can do a lot with it. The book is helping me to
really understand how powerful Lua can be. Actually, I don&rsquo;t think that
all I&rsquo;m learning is necessary to implement plugins. I keep studying
because I&rsquo;m enjoying Lua. :)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started the lua-plugin that I&rsquo;ll be using in the next steps of my
GSoC project. It&rsquo;ll be about Lyrics, using an available API of
<a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/">Metrolyrics</a>. This plugin will help me for
the next 4 weeks or so with a subset of Grilo functions.</p>

<p>Good news is that I&rsquo;ll attend to GUADEC in Brno, Czech Republic in
August. It will be an amazing trip and I&rsquo;ll hopefully meet some of the
people that helped me to achieve all this.</p>
