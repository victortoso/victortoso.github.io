        <description>gom Most of the work I&amp;rsquo;ve being doing since last report is improving the TVDB source in Grilo Plugins in order to have a cache for all data that you have once downloaded from thetvdb.com.
I&amp;rsquo;m doing that with gom.
At first I thought it was a bit complicated as creating sql queries directly is easier. But under the hood gom does a lot of useful things that you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to bother thinking.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m doing that with gom.
At first I thought it was a bit complicated as creating sql queries directly is easier. But under the hood gom does a lot of useful things that you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to bother thinking. It is good to see that it was moved to git.gnome.org.
Also, It was really good to see Magnatune working when I was reading the last post from Sai. It was my first patch to GNOME :). I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about updating the Magnatune source with gom in the near future and probably with more features. Let&amp;rsquo;s see!
Note: One could check the thetvdb source patches here.
Next The integration with GNOME Videos! I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see this working :)
Guadec Oh yeah! I loved last year conference and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t miss this year. Thanks very much to the GNOME Foundation for helping out with the sponsorship.
