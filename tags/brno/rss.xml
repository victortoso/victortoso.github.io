                <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the Google Summer of Code 2014 so many things have
happened that It is really hard to make a simple blog post about it...
but I must try :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-job&quot;&gt;New job&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, along with the GSoC I&#x27;ve applied to a job at &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redhat.com&#x2F;en&quot;&gt;Red
Hat&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the process ended in August. Since
October 15th I am part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spice-space.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Spice&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; team
and I will be working at the Brno office in Czech Republic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really excited with the work and with the team. I am learning a lot
already.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-city&quot;&gt;New City&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have visited Brno at &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.victortoso.com&#x2F;brno-guadec-and-grilo.html&quot;&gt;GUADEC
2013&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, lovely
city. I feel safe here unlike Campinas in Brazil.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have great expectations about living here and so do my wife after
reading Christian&#x27;s blog post about &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.gnome.org&#x2F;uraeus&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;01&#x2F;leaving-brno&#x2F;&quot;&gt;leaving
Brno&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;married&quot;&gt;Married&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay ;) Yes, biggest decision of my life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been together for almost three years now and we were living
together for almost one year which made this decision straightforward
for me. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.catielle.com.br&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Catielle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a wonderful person
and I am really happy with our marriage. I feel that we are going to be
very happy here in Brno.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pending&quot;&gt;Pending&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I was quite a busy in the last two months but I still have a lot
of things to do!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few blog posts about GUADEC, GSoC and Grilo I want to move this Blog
to Pelican :-) Finishing off a few things related to the last GSoC
project, making it upstream! Writing a documentation for the lua-factory
plugin :-)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s all for now! I will be back hacking and blogging now that things
are getting calmer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Brno is amazing. Just amazing. The people from here try to be helpfull
even if they don&#x27;t speak a single word in English. The food is really
good and quite cheap and the city is beautiful! I&#x27;m glad that I still
have time for another tour around!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, travelling without many concerns, meeting amazing people and with
the opportunity to learn things you love... GUADEC has been an amazing
experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks were really good but the people I have met here are awesome.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m really glad to finally meet my mentor Juan Suárez and some folks
from Red Hat. It was awesome to talk with some others interns such as
Kalev, Marcos, Valentín, Alessandro, Bogdan and Carlos. It was brief but
really nice. Hope to meet everybody again next year!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in GUADEC I had a lightning talk trying to briefly explain what my
GSoC is about. It was hard to do it in less then 3 minutes. I was quite
nervous too but everything went well :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anybody would like to know more about grilo or anything related ping
me on #grilo&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to talk with Juan about the GSoC project, Grilo
and some plans for the future. I&#x27;m a bit excited to keep contributing to
Grilo.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank GNOME Fundation for the sponsorship and making
this travel possible; to Google for the Summer of Code Program; to
Fabiano Fidêncio for helping me A LOT in Brno.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#x27;s all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;1306-01-gnome-sponsored-badge.png&quot; alt=&quot;GNOME rocks!&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
