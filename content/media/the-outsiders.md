What a nice 1983's surprise. Found this one after looking for over half-hour for something to watch.
I was expecting a simple plot, that is, nothing that would make me think about it the next day. It
does look like a simple `coming-of-age` type of movie at first, but surely not a light one, and made
me reflect a bit on my infancy.

Getting to know Robert Frost's poem [Nothing Gold Can Stay][] was in itself, worth the movie:

```
Robert Frost - 1874-1963

Nature’s first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf’s a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay.
```

I'm adding the [the novel][] that the movie was adapted from to my future reads.
