      <p>First of all, hello everybody from Planet Gnome! This is the first post
that will take place there. It is a really nice community where I've
been learning always something new from the past 5 months. I hope I can
put some interesting hacks for you guys.</p>
<p>Thank you <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/AlbertoRuiz">Alberto Ruiz</a> for
including me.</p>
<p>I was
<a href="http://www.victortoso.com/magnatune-upstream-and-gsoc.html">accepted</a>
in GSoC this year to be working with
<a href="https://live.gnome.org/Grilo">Grilo</a>. It is a really nice project which
I'm always having some fun while coding. I'm being mentored by <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/JuanSuarez">Juan
Suarez</a> who has been always helpful
with my problems.</p>
<p>Grilo is basically a framework to get content through plugins. A lot of
plugins were made already and all were written in C. My GSoC project is
about making possible to write plugins in <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>.</p>
<p>About the project itself, I'll be writing a glue-code between Grilo and
Lua. They'll be tagged as lua-factory as the c code dealing with lua;
and grilo-library as a library written in c to be used by the
lua-plugins.</p>
<p>I tried to make a simple design to represent how grilo and grilo-plugins
works now and where my code will take place.</p>
<p><img src="/images/1304-01-grilo-and-lua-factory.png" alt="Design of Grilo + Grilo Plugins with Lua-Factory and Lua sources" /></p>
<p>The 'search' is one of the subset commands that Grilo can request.</p>
<p>The progress in the moment I'm writing this post is that the lyric
plugin get the content (by 'search' and 'browse') and I'm able to load
the plugin with my current lua-factory but can't perform any command
yet.</p>
<p>I guest this is it about GSoC for now :)</p>
<p>I would also like to say to those who followed me here, we have at least
three Brazilians interns in GNOME this year: <a href="https://15experience.wordpress.com/">Rafael
Fonseca</a>, <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/MelissaWen">Melissa
Wen</a> and myself. Brazil is in such
crazy historical moment right now.</p>
<p>If you know absolute nothing about it please do :)</p>
<p>To finish this post, this beautiful GNOME cup that my girlfriend gave to
me in my birthday.</p>
