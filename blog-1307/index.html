    <div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>It's been a while since my last post just after GUADEC. I've lost some
time in August due moving to a new place in Campinas with two friends of
mine. It was three weeks ago and I'm still feeling tired (I'm taking
some time to get used with this new place).</p>
<p>Since then, I'm working on grilo-plugins and this post is all about what
I've accomplished and what are the next steps after GSoC.</p>
<h3 id="the-post-is-bigger-then-usual-so-grab-a-cup-of-coffee"><em>(The post is bigger then usual so... grab a cup of coffee !)</em></h3>
<p>As <a href="http://www.victortoso.com/planet-gsoc-project-and-brazil.html">I told
before</a>,
Grilo has some commands that are translated to the source like Search
and Browse operations. Good part of my project was translating this
commands from Grilo to the Lua source and the result of this work was
the lua-factory plugin.</p>
<p>The subset of commands available to Lua sources are: Search, Browse,
Query, Resolve, May Resolve, Store and Remove. I've developed two Lua
sources that implement those commands besides the last two (Store and
Remove) due a library dependency that will be commented bellow.</p>
<p>Those Lua sources are <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/">Metrolyrics</a> and
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> which already exists as C source.</p>
<p>Due the limitations of the standards libraries of Lua and the need of
interaction with Grilo itself the lua library was created. This is a set
of lua modules that are helpful for the developers. Those modules could
be wrappers of C librarys or custom functions.</p>
<p>For instance, to be able to interact with Flickr web service a wrapper
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">oauth</a> library was created;</p>
<p>And all this were just the first steps;</p>
<h2 id="current-issues-that-should-be-improved">Current issues that should be improved</h2>
<p>The main goal of the GSoC project was being able to write plugins with
Lua and them should be transparent to Grilo, making no difference
between a C or Lua source. I feel that was accomplished but no without
problems, lets check some of them <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>If the reader see more problems not listed, feel free to comment it!</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The annoying userdata: To perform the callback from Lua source to
the Application, we need to store the userdata passed from
lua-factory somehow. There are a couple of ways of doing it but I
didn't made it work before GUADEC and it was kind of low priority
after; For instance, the Search operation in Lua should be a
function called grl_source_search() wich have two parameters:
(1) a Table with the data that the functions need; (2) An userdata which
is a pointer to a structure in C (which is no useful for Lua code); A
better approach is storing this in the Lua stack, hiding from lua code;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving the GrlNet library with the possibility to POST content to
the web. This was the reason that I didn't implement Store and
Remove in the Lua Flickr source :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A better callback implementation (or a totally different one). This
is one of the topics I talked with
<a href="http://www.igalia.com/nc/igalia-247/igalian/item/jasuarez/">Juan</a>
in GUADEC and this could actually be expanded to Grilo itself so,
I'll keep it to another post;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More sources! In order to be sure that this code is trustable a few
more sources are needed; They will be implemented after the two
first topics! <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>)</p>
</li>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>If the reader want to see a source implemented to Grilo,
tell me! I'm kind of building a small list :)</p>
</div>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-last-week-of-gsoc-period">The last week of GSoC Period</h2>
<p>This week I'm not writing much code but trying to make a useful
documentation to help other developers.</p>
<p>But as we can see in google's
<a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2013">timeline</a>,
next week I'll be submitting the source code I've developed so far.</p>
<p>It will be the last week of GSoC but not my last in Grilo or in this
project. Hopefully, I'll have a few more improvements in the end of
October!</p>
<p>A big thanks to Juan for all the feedback, help and insights! I've made
big steps these last three months and you help me out everytime :)</p>
<h2 id="final-considerations">Final considerations</h2>
<p>I've enjoyed a lot this period! I've learnt a lot! I've met amazing
people! I've traveled more then 10'000Km to a beautiful city to attend a
super conference! I've learnt Lua (and loving it!)</p>
<p>I'm lucky. Thanks to GNOME and Google for that!</p>
<p>Wow, you made it till here. You can reclaim a beer in the next GUADEC!</p>
<p>Did you know ? Grilo is a type of bug in Brazil ? A Cricket !</p>
