<p>Nothing like talking about Grilo to keep the blog going and to be honest
I have some interesting things to talk about.</p>

<h2 id="grilo-0-3">Grilo 0.3</h2>

<p>The major release happened almost 6 months ago and it has brought some
API/ABI changes being my favourite the merge of all Grilo media types
into GrlMedia
(<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755551">#755551</a>); This
introduces support from Grilo to different types of media!</p>

<p>Well, to be pedantic, it was always possible to have different media
types in Grilo on GrlMedia but it is more clear to applications by
merging GrlMedia{Audio,Video,Image,Box} in GrlMedia; It should also help
us to identify problems with media types that were not originally
supported, such as
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=767182">#767182</a></p>

<p>I expect this change will increase the interest in Grilo for a whole new
set of applications. For instance, with
<a href="http://thegamesdb.net/">TheGamesDB</a> source we got support to metadata
for Games
(<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=766678">#766678</a>) and I&rsquo;m
excited to see how <a href="http://bytesgnomeschozo.blogspot.cz/">Kekun</a> will be
using this in the gnome-games project!</p>

<h2 id="plugins">Plugins</h2>

<p>A few other plugins have landed upstream as well. I&rsquo;ve mentioned
TheGamesDB before but we also have iTunes Podcast, both written by
<a href="http://www.hadess.net/">Bastien</a>.</p>

<p>I was able to finally finish a plugin related to my GSoC in 2014:
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=732879">AcoustID</a>. In the
end, we decided to split the audio decoding and the audio&rsquo;s fingerprint
generation in one plugin called Chromaprint and another plugin that
actually fetch data on AcoustID web service.</p>

<p>It took some time and the learning process was quite great by learning
GStreamer from scratch. As always, many thanks to Bastien for the
guidance and also to <a href="https://twitter.com/thgss">thiagoss</a> by helping
out with the GStreamer bits :-)</p>

<p>PS: Three of the four plugins above were written in Lua :-)</p>

<h2 id="google-summer-of-code-2016">Google Summer of Code 2016</h2>

<p>And we already are in the development phase of GSoC 2016! As always,
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/SummerOfCode/2016/Projects/">exciting
projects</a>
in GNOME.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m particularly interested in
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Music">Music</a> this year. <a href="https://gnarula.com/">Gaurav
Narula</a> is working to have <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/SummerOfCode/2016/Projects/GauravNarula_MusicOwnCloud">ownCloud
Support</a>
and <a href="https://saifulbkhan.wordpress.com/">Saiful Khan</a> will be making
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/SummerOfCode/2016/Projects/SaifulBariKhan_MusicTagEditing">Audio Tag
Editing</a>
possible from Music. The #gnome-music channel has been quite active by
having interesting and amusing discussions. I guess this will be a good
year for Music.</p>

<p>Big expectations as well with <a href="https://alexandruvisarion.wordpress.com/">Alexandru
Visarion</a> working on Boxes in
order to have <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/SummerOfCode/2016/Projects/AlexandruVisarion_BoxesSpiceFeatures">More Spice
Features</a>
- Yay! It was sheer coincidence as today we were discussing about shared
folders with Spice&rsquo;s webdav. That will be great to land in Boxes!</p>

<p>I wish all the students a great learning experience.</p>

<h2 id="other-news">Other news</h2>

<p>Grilo has piqued my interest since before 2013 as neat project that I
could be using in one Set-Top Box that I had in hands; it then became
the project for my first free software contribution; it has been nearly
two years since my second GSoC but I&rsquo;m still having fun with Grilo.</p>

<p>So, you could imagine how happy I am to become
<a href="https://twitter.com/victortoso/status/740079518984118272">co-maintainer</a>
to this great project :)</p>
