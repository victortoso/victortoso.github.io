My name is Victor Toso and I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer based
in the city of [Colle di Val d'Elsa][], Italy.

I'm currently working in the Virtualization team of [Red Hat][] in projects
that relate to [QEMU][], [Libvirt][] and [KubeVirt][]. I've also worked a few
years in the [SPICE][] project together with the Red Hat's Desktop team.

I've been a proud member of the [GNOME][] community and a foundation member
since 2014.
