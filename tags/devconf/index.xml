      <description>Once again at DevConf CZ but now to talk about SPICE and its integration with GStreamer. Together with my friend and colleague Pavel Grunt we give a brief explanation about how SPICE works and then we focus on the image display and video streaming part of SPICE protocol while trying to clarify why streaming is so important to remote desktops.</description>

      <description>The DevConf CZ is a three-day conference that brings different communities of developers together in Brno, Czech Republic. Organized by Red Hat, this conference offers several interesting topics on talks or workshops. Great to keep yourself up-to-date on fast evolving technologies.
My collegues presented Spice on Windows describing the process to deliver Windows builds of SPICE components from a Linux machine. As extra, Virgl + Spice (Linux-only) was showed in the end, check it out!</description>
