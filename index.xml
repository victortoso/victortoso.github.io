Found this one after looking over half hour for something to watch. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting a plot that would make me think about it next day. It does look like a simple comming of age type of movie. It may be, but not a light one. Just by getting to know Robert Frost&amp;rsquo;s poem Nothing Gold Can Stay was worth the movie:
Robert Frost - 1874-1963 Natureâ€™s first green is gold, Her hardest hue to hold.</description></item><item><title>Generating Cgo for libvirt</title><link>https://victortoso.com/code/generating-cgo-code/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victortoso.com/code/generating-cgo-code/</guid><description>Preface The libvirt-go-module project provides Go bindings to use libvirt&amp;rsquo;s library. It wraps libvirt&amp;rsquo;s C types and APIs into Go types and methods. The wrapping involves writing a bit of Cgo code that looks like the following:
759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 /* connect_wrapper.go from libvirt-go-module version v1.8009.0 */ virConnectPtr virConnectOpenWrapper(const char *name, virErrorPtr err) { virConnectPtr ret = virConnectOpen(name); if (!ret) { virCopyLastError(err); } return ret; } In this example, we are calling libvirt&amp;rsquo;s virConnectOpen() to stablish connection with the underlying hypervisor.</description></item><item><title>All You Need is Kill</title><link>https://victortoso.com/media/all-you-need-is-kill/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victortoso.com/media/all-you-need-is-kill/</guid><description>goodreads wikipedia I bought myself this manga as Christmas gift as I was interested in reading it again. This was the third time I&amp;rsquo;ve read it. This concept of redoing things is something I can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of, combined with science fiction and a little bit of mechas makes this manga a pure blast.</description></item><item><title>Alice in Borderland</title><link>https://victortoso.com/media/alice-in-borderland/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victortoso.com/media/alice-in-borderland/</guid><description>wikipedia Watched the second season.

I did not find it exceptional but still, looking forward for a second season.</description></item></channel></rss>
