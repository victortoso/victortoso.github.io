      <description>Hey :) I usually write my posts in the weekend when I do have more time to think about what I&amp;rsquo;ve done and what It is interesting to share. Sadly, two weekends ago I was ill due something I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten and now I&amp;rsquo;ll try to summarize two weeks in one post!
The TVDB Is now upstream. Yay!
The main care after implementing the cache with Gom was handling multiple requests of the same TV Show in a short period of time (concurrency).</description>

      <description>Keep moving! One of the great features of the TVDB is all the image gallery that they have and provide. To get as much interesting data as possible using Grilo we need to extend our source and a great way to do it is through creating custom metadata-keys.
With these newly created metadata-keys the TVDB source can now provide an url to the most voted Fanart, Poster and Banner of the tv show.</description>

      <description>Start This is the first weekend since the beginning of GSoC coding period and it has been satisfactory. For those that have no clue on what I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on this summer, part of it is implementing TV Shows support in GNOME Videos!
In order to provide all information necessary to the interface, we will be using Grilo with the The TVDB source which is what I&amp;rsquo;m working on at the moment.</description>
