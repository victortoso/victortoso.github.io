<p>Since the end of the Google Summer of Code 2014 so many things have
happened that It is really hard to make a simple blog post about it&hellip;
but I must try :)</p>

<h2 id="new-job">New job</h2>

<p>Well, along with the GSoC I&rsquo;ve applied to a job at <a href="http://www.redhat.com/en">Red
Hat</a> and the process ended in August. Since
October 15th I am part of the <a href="http://www.spice-space.org/">Spice</a> team
and I will be working at the Brno office in Czech Republic.</p>

<p>I am really excited with the work and with the team. I am learning a lot
already.</p>

<h2 id="new-city">New City</h2>

<p>I have visited Brno at <a href="http://www.victortoso.com/brno-guadec-and-grilo.html">GUADEC
2013</a>, lovely
city. I feel safe here unlike Campinas in Brazil.</p>

<p>I have great expectations about living here and so do my wife after
reading Christian&rsquo;s blog post about <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2014/09/01/leaving-brno/">leaving
Brno</a>.</p>

<h2 id="married">Married</h2>

<p>Yay ;) Yes, biggest decision of my life.</p>

<p>We have been together for almost three years now and we were living
together for almost one year which made this decision straightforward
for me. <a href="http://www.catielle.com.br/">Catielle</a> is a wonderful person
and I am really happy with our marriage. I feel that we are going to be
very happy here in Brno.</p>

<h2 id="pending">Pending</h2>

<p>Well, I was quite a busy in the last two months but I still have a lot
of things to do!</p>

<p>A few blog posts about GUADEC, GSoC and Grilo I want to move this Blog
to Pelican :-) Finishing off a few things related to the last GSoC
project, making it upstream! Writing a documentation for the lua-factory
plugin :-)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for now! I will be back hacking and blogging now that things
are getting calmer.</p>
