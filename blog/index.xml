      <title>Playing with Desktop Integration</title>
      <link>http://victortoso.com/blog/1602/</link>

      <description>Thanks to a bug found in Spice&amp;rsquo;s drag and drop implementation, I was able to improve the integration of our guest agent (spice-vdagent) with the Desktop Session on Linux and Windows. I enjoyed the process to solve those problems so I thought a blog post could be interesting as well.
The problem If you use Spice you might enjoy the feature of copying files from your client machine to the guest by simply using the drag and drop feature.</description>

      <title>Grilo updates!</title>

      <description>Nothing like talking about Grilo to keep the blog going and to be honest I have some interesting things to talk about.
Grilo 0.3 The major release happened almost 6 months ago and it has brought some API/ABI changes being my favourite the merge of all Grilo media types into GrlMedia (#755551); This introduces support from Grilo to different types of media!
Well, to be pedantic, it was always possible to have different media types in Grilo on GrlMedia but it is more clear to applications by merging GrlMedia{Audio,Video,Image,Box} in GrlMedia; It should also help us to identify problems with media types that were not originally supported, such as #767182</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been almost one year since my last blog post. One year since I got married and left Brazil to live in Czech Republic. In my last post I talked about all the changes I was passing through but no change is bigger than having a baby. Tereza has almost 4 months now :)
One year at Red Hat and Spice.
Even with the great amount of things to do in personal and professional life, I want to keep making GNOME better as much as I can in my free time and thus I want to get back to blogging again.</description>

      <description>Since the end of the Google Summer of Code 2014 so many things have happened that It is really hard to make a simple blog post about it&amp;hellip; but I must try :)
New job Well, along with the GSoC I&amp;rsquo;ve applied to a job at Red Hat and the process ended in August. Since October 15th I am part of the Spice team and I will be working at the Brno office in Czech Republic.</description>

      <description>Tuesday&amp;hellip; Two weeks without posting again! Can I use as an excuse my grief for Brazil in this World Cup!? :) Well, actually I was somewhat busy studying&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll share what in a moment.
In order to talk about what I&amp;rsquo;m working on I would like to explain one interesting feature that Grilo has.
Cool thing in Grilo? You may know that Grilo uses plugins to fetch useful data to your application!</description>

      <description>Hey :) I usually write my posts in the weekend when I do have more time to think about what I&amp;rsquo;ve done and what It is interesting to share. Sadly, two weekends ago I was ill due something I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten and now I&amp;rsquo;ll try to summarize two weeks in one post!
The TVDB Is now upstream. Yay!
The main care after implementing the cache with Gom was handling multiple requests of the same TV Show in a short period of time (concurrency).</description>

      <description>gom Most of the work I&amp;rsquo;ve being doing since last report is improving the TVDB source in Grilo Plugins in order to have a cache for all data that you have once downloaded from thetvdb.com.
I&amp;rsquo;m doing that with gom.
At first I thought it was a bit complicated as creating sql queries directly is easier. But under the hood gom does a lot of useful things that you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to bother thinking.</description>

      <description>Keep moving! One of the great features of the TVDB is all the image gallery that they have and provide. To get as much interesting data as possible using Grilo we need to extend our source and a great way to do it is through creating custom metadata-keys.
With these newly created metadata-keys the TVDB source can now provide an url to the most voted Fanart, Poster and Banner of the tv show.</description>

      <description>Start This is the first weekend since the beginning of GSoC coding period and it has been satisfactory. For those that have no clue on what I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on this summer, part of it is implementing TV Shows support in GNOME Videos!
In order to provide all information necessary to the interface, we will be using Grilo with the The TVDB source which is what I&amp;rsquo;m working on at the moment.</description>

      <description>Another great summer is coming I was accepted, once again, at Google Summer of Code program! I am really excited with the project. I&amp;rsquo;ll have fun with Grilo again by implementing a few new plugins and integrating them to Videos and Music.
Check the wiki of the project for more info.
Many thanks to Google for this amazing program and to Bastien, which will be mentoring me during this period.</description>

      <title>Lua-Factory available upstream</title>

      <description>It has been four months since the GSoC 2013 code submission. At that time the Lua-Factory Plugin was usable but yet with some issues to be dealt.
It was in the last two weeks that most of those issues were solved together with a few recommendations from Juan and Bastien and tonight it was merged upstream in Grilo-Plugins repository.
Hooray!
The documentation for implementing a Lua sources will come soon.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last post just after GUADEC. I&amp;rsquo;ve lost some time in August due moving to a new place in Campinas with two friends of mine. It was three weeks ago and I&amp;rsquo;m still feeling tired (I&amp;rsquo;m taking some time to get used with this new place).
Since then, I&amp;rsquo;m working on grilo-plugins and this post is all about what I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished and what are the next steps after GSoC.</description>

      <description>Brno is amazing. Just amazing. The people from here try to be helpfull even if they don&amp;rsquo;t speak a single word in English. The food is really good and quite cheap and the city is beautiful! I&amp;rsquo;m glad that I still have time for another tour around!
Well, travelling without many concerns, meeting amazing people and with the opportunity to learn things you love&amp;hellip; GUADEC has been an amazing experience.</description>

      <description>Oh boy, there are things that can slow you down. It&amp;rsquo;s been three weeks since my last post, in this short period of time I had a car accident ( I&amp;rsquo;m 100% alright! ), one root canal treatment (with a good dose of pain), my girlfriend moved to another city&amp;hellip; Oh well, too many headaches in three weeks!
But when I was in good mood (or healthy enough) here I was, in front of this screen trying to make good code to Grilo&amp;hellip; and I like the achievements so far.</description>

      <description>First of all, hello everybody from Planet Gnome! This is the first post that will take place there. It is a really nice community where I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning always something new from the past 5 months. I hope I can put some interesting hacks for you guys.
Thank you Alberto Ruiz for including me.
I was accepted in GSoC this year to be working with Grilo. It is a really nice project which I&amp;rsquo;m always having some fun while coding.</description>

      <description>First of all, as a good beginner in blogging I have promised that
I&#39;ll make a proper introducing of the project later this week  which I did not. Sorry for that. I hope to do it soon.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying Lua since last weekend with the good guidance of the Programming in Lua (written by Roberto Ierusalimschy as a way to improve my lua skills. Actually, before starting reading this book I thought my knowledge of lua was _[ok]() because it is easy to understand and make some code.</description>

      <description>I was having a busy week until this Sunday which happened to be my birthday!
I just made 25 years old and the celebration with my family was remarkable.
I&amp;rsquo;m just happy with such great family.
But besides my family, two amazing things made this last three days quite unforgettable.
First, my first code to an open source community reached the upstream! As posted by Juan, within the 0.2.8 release of grilo-plugins is included the Magnatune plugin.</description>

      <description>Time goes by when you finally finish your 18 years studying things that people said you need to learn. Finally you start doing more and more things that you want to do. Learning what you think is interesting and working with what you love.
I&amp;rsquo;m entering in a new phase of my life.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in a few projects that made most of my days goes by in a blink of an eye.</description>
