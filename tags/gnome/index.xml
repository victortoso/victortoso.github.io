        <description>The DevConf CZ is a three-day conference that brings different communities of developers together in Brno, Czech Republic. Organized by Red Hat, this conference offers several interesting topics on talks or workshops. Great to keep yourself up-to-date on fast evolving technologies.
My collegues presented Spice on Windows describing the process to deliver Windows builds of SPICE components from a Linux machine. As extra, Virgl &#43; Spice (Linux-only) was showed in the end, check it out!</description>

My collegues presented Spice on Windows describing the process to deliver Windows builds of SPICE components from a Linux machine. As extra, Virgl &#43; Spice (Linux-only) was showed in the end, check it out!
As SPICE was covered by very capable hands, I talked about Grilo once again but covering it all the way from application side using Grilo core and the the usage and development of Grilo plugins.

        <description>GUADEC 2014 took place in Strasbourg, France and that was my first time in this beautiful country. My friend Watson Sato was also enrolled in the GSoC on GNOME and we were able to travel and attend the conference together.
The time slot per intern for the light talk was very short once again but everybody was able to summarize their work very well. Sadly the video was not uploaded.</description>

        <description>Another great summer is coming I was accepted, once again, at Google Summer of Code program! I am really excited with the project. I&amp;rsquo;ll have fun with Grilo again by implementing a few new plugins and integrating them to Videos and Music.
Check the wiki of the project for more info.
Many thanks to Google for this amazing program and to Bastien, which will be mentoring me during this period.</description>

        <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last post just after GUADEC. I&amp;rsquo;ve lost some time in August due moving to a new place in Campinas with two friends of mine. It was three weeks ago and I&amp;rsquo;m still feeling tired (I&amp;rsquo;m taking some time to get used with this new place).
Since then, I&amp;rsquo;m working on grilo-plugins and this post is all about what I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished and what are the next steps after GSoC.</description>
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last post just after GUADEC. I&amp;rsquo;ve lost some time in August due moving to a new place in Campinas with two friends of mine. It was three weeks ago and I&amp;rsquo;m still feeling tired (I&amp;rsquo;m taking some time to get used with this new place).
Since then, I&amp;rsquo;m working on grilo-plugins and this post is all about what I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished and what are the next steps after GSoC.
(The post is bigger then usual so&amp;hellip; grab a cup of coffee !) As I told before, Grilo has some commands that are translated to the source like Search and Browse operations. Good part of my project was translating this commands from Grilo to the Lua source and the result of this work was the lua-factory plugin.
The subset of commands available to Lua sources are: Search, Browse, Query, Resolve, May Resolve, Store and Remove. I&amp;rsquo;ve developed two Lua sources that implement those commands besides the last two (Store and Remove) due a library dependency that will be commented bellow.
Those Lua sources are Metrolyrics and Flickr which already exists as C source.
Due the limitations of the standards libraries of Lua and the need of interaction with Grilo itself the lua library was created. This is a set of lua modules that are helpful for the developers. Those modules could be wrappers of C librarys or custom functions.
For instance, to be able to interact with Flickr web service a wrapper of oauth library was created;
And all this were just the first steps;
Current issues that should be improved The main goal of the GSoC project was being able to write plugins with Lua and them should be transparent to Grilo, making no difference between a C or Lua source. I feel that was accomplished but no without problems, lets check some of them 1:
 The annoying userdata: To perform the callback from Lua source to the Application, we need to store the userdata passed from lua-factory somehow. There are a couple of ways of doing it but I didn&amp;rsquo;t made it work before GUADEC and it was kind of low priority after; For instance, the Search operation in Lua should be a function called grl_source_search() wich have two parameters: (1) a Table with the data that the functions need; (2) An userdata which is a pointer to a structure in C (which is no useful for Lua code); A better approach is storing this in the Lua stack, hiding from lua code;
 Improving the GrlNet library with the possibility to POST content to the web. This was the reason that I didn&amp;rsquo;t implement Store and Remove in the Lua Flickr source :(
 A better callback implementation (or a totally different one). This is one of the topics I talked with Juan in GUADEC and this could actually be expanded to Grilo itself so, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it to another post;
 More sources! In order to be sure that this code is trustable a few more sources are needed; They will be implemented after the two first topics! 2)
  The last week of GSoC Period This week I&amp;rsquo;m not writing much code but trying to make a useful documentation to help other developers.
But as we can see in google&amp;rsquo;s timeline, next week I&amp;rsquo;ll be submitting the source code I&amp;rsquo;ve developed so far.
It will be the last week of GSoC but not my last in Grilo or in this project. Hopefully, I&amp;rsquo;ll have a few more improvements in the end of October!
A big thanks to Juan for all the feedback, help and insights! I&amp;rsquo;ve made big steps these last three months and you help me out everytime :)
Final considerations I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed a lot this period! I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a lot! I&amp;rsquo;ve met amazing people! I&amp;rsquo;ve traveled more then 10&amp;rsquo;000Km to a beautiful city to attend a super conference! I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt Lua (and loving it!)
I&amp;rsquo;m lucky. Thanks to GNOME and Google for that!
Wow, you made it till here. You can reclaim a beer in the next GUADEC!
Did you know ? Grilo is a type of bug in Brazil ? A Cricket !
 If the reader see more problems not listed, feel free to comment it! ↩ If the reader want to see a source implemented to Grilo, tell me! I&amp;rsquo;m kind of building a small list :)

        <description>Brno is amazing. Just amazing. The people from here try to be helpfull even if they don&amp;rsquo;t speak a single word in English. The food is really good and quite cheap and the city is beautiful! I&amp;rsquo;m glad that I still have time for another tour around!
Well, travelling without many concerns, meeting amazing people and with the opportunity to learn things you love&amp;hellip; GUADEC has been an amazing experience.</description>

Well, travelling without many concerns, meeting amazing people and with the opportunity to learn things you love&amp;hellip; GUADEC has been an amazing experience.
The talks were really good but the people I have met here are awesome.
I&amp;rsquo;m really glad to finally meet my mentor Juan Suárez and some folks from Red Hat. It was awesome to talk with some others interns such as Kalev, Marcos, Valentín, Alessandro, Bogdan and Carlos. It was brief but really nice. Hope to meet everybody again next year!
Here in GUADEC I had a lightning talk trying to briefly explain what my GSoC is about. It was hard to do it in less then 3 minutes. I was quite nervous too but everything went well :)
If anybody would like to know more about grilo or anything related ping me on #grilo
I had the opportunity to talk with Juan about the GSoC project, Grilo and some plans for the future. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit excited to keep contributing to Grilo.
I would like to thank GNOME Fundation for the sponsorship and making this travel possible; to Google for the Summer of Code Program; to Fabiano Fidêncio for helping me A LOT in Brno.
And that&amp;rsquo;s all.

        <description>GUADEC 2013 was hosted in Brno, Czech Republic and it was my first time doing a talk for a big audience, quite an experience! I can see how nervous I got in the two minutes I had for the interns lightning talk.
Not super instructive video to watch but quite funny to me :)
Also, It is very interesting that a little bit more then a year later, I would be moving to Brno to start a new phase of my life.</description>

        <description>Oh boy, there are things that can slow you down. It&amp;rsquo;s been three weeks since my last post, in this short period of time I had a car accident ( I&amp;rsquo;m 100% alright! ), one root canal treatment (with a good dose of pain), my girlfriend moved to another city&amp;hellip; Oh well, too many headaches in three weeks!
But when I was in good mood (or healthy enough) here I was, in front of this screen trying to make good code to Grilo&amp;hellip; and I like the achievements so far.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s been three weeks since my last post, in this short period of time I had a car accident ( I&amp;rsquo;m 100% alright! ), one root canal treatment (with a good dose of pain), my girlfriend moved to another city&amp;hellip; Oh well, too many headaches in three weeks!
But when I was in good mood (or healthy enough) here I was, in front of this screen trying to make good code to Grilo&amp;hellip; and I like the achievements so far. Lets take a look.
I started to implement the Metrolyrics plugin before writing any C code to Grilo in order to have a lua-based plugin to use. A lot of this plugin has changed to work with lua-factory. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t remember, lua-factory is part of grilo-plugins, and it is the glue-code in charge to load-and-use the lua-plugins.
In this moment, we can use the Search, Browse, Query and Resolve operations from Grilo to this lua-plugin.
As the lua code needs some help from C to perform a few operations, lua-library was created to be a module to lua. This module has two functions implemented: Fetch, to perform async fetch from web and Callback, to return the content to the application.
A lot has to be done yet. Hopefully without any personal headache :)
For instance:
 Store and Remove operations must be implemented in lua-factory; Log and Error functions to the lua-library; Better care with user configs, metadata-keys Solving some problems with UTF-8 chars  I will be writing a new lua-plugin this week and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to choose between Soundcloud or Last.fm. Both have the necessary features to be implemented that Metrolyrics lacks for Grilo.
Well, I intend to make my next post in Brno before GUADEC and another post after with much more GNOMExperience&amp;hellip;

        <description>First of all, hello everybody from Planet Gnome! This is the first post that will take place there. It is a really nice community where I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning always something new from the past 5 months. I hope I can put some interesting hacks for you guys.
Thank you Alberto Ruiz for including me.
I was accepted in GSoC this year to be working with Grilo. It is a really nice project which I&amp;rsquo;m always having some fun while coding.</description>

Thank you Alberto Ruiz for including me.
I was accepted in GSoC this year to be working with Grilo. It is a really nice project which I&amp;rsquo;m always having some fun while coding. I&amp;rsquo;m being mentored by Juan Suarez who has been always helpful with my problems.
Grilo is basically a framework to get content through plugins. A lot of plugins were made already and all were written in C. My GSoC project is about making possible to write plugins in Lua.
About the project itself, I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing a glue-code between Grilo and Lua. They&amp;rsquo;ll be tagged as lua-factory as the c code dealing with lua; and grilo-library as a library written in c to be used by the lua-plugins.
I tried to make a simple design to represent how grilo and grilo-plugins works now and where my code will take place.
The &amp;lsquo;search&amp;rsquo; is one of the subset commands that Grilo can request.
The progress in the moment I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post is that the lyric plugin get the content (by &amp;lsquo;search&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;browse&amp;rsquo;) and I&amp;rsquo;m able to load the plugin with my current lua-factory but can&amp;rsquo;t perform any command yet.
I guest this is it about GSoC for now :)
I would also like to say to those who followed me here, we have at least three Brazilians interns in GNOME this year: Rafael Fonseca, Melissa Wen and myself. Brazil is in such crazy historical moment right now.
If you know absolute nothing about it please do :)
To finish this post, this beautiful GNOME cup that my girlfriend gave to me in my birthday.

        <description>First of all, as a good beginner in blogging I have promised that
I&#39;ll make a proper introducing of the project later this week  which I did not. Sorry for that. I hope to do it soon.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying Lua since last weekend with the good guidance of the Programming in Lua (written by Roberto Ierusalimschy as a way to improve my lua skills. Actually, before starting reading this book I thought my knowledge of lua was _[ok]() because it is easy to understand and make some code.</description>

Actually, before starting reading this book I thought my knowledge of lua was _[ok]() because it is easy to understand and make some code. Naive!
Lua is simple but we can do a lot with it. The book is helping me to really understand how powerful Lua can be. Actually, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that all I&amp;rsquo;m learning is necessary to implement plugins. I keep studying because I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying Lua. :)
I&amp;rsquo;ve started the lua-plugin that I&amp;rsquo;ll be using in the next steps of my GSoC project. It&amp;rsquo;ll be about Lyrics, using an available API of Metrolyrics. This plugin will help me for the next 4 weeks or so with a subset of Grilo functions.
Good news is that I&amp;rsquo;ll attend to GUADEC in Brno, Czech Republic in August. It will be an amazing trip and I&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully meet some of the people that helped me to achieve all this.

        <description>I was having a busy week until this Sunday which happened to be my birthday!
I just made 25 years old and the celebration with my family was remarkable.
I&amp;rsquo;m just happy with such great family.
But besides my family, two amazing things made this last three days quite unforgettable.
First, my first code to an open source community reached the upstream! As posted by Juan, within the 0.2.8 release of grilo-plugins is included the Magnatune plugin.</description>

Second, I was accepted at Google Summer of Code program to keep working with grilo! I&amp;rsquo;ll make a proper introducing of the project later this week but the reader can have an idea at the abstract page.
Thanks to GNOME and Google for it.
 A lot is happening and I&amp;rsquo;m full of good expectations.  :)

        <description>Time goes by when you finally finish your 18 years studying things that people said you need to learn. Finally you start doing more and more things that you want to do. Learning what you think is interesting and working with what you love.
I&amp;rsquo;m entering in a new phase of my life.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in a few projects that made most of my days goes by in a blink of an eye.</description>
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Time goes by when you finally finish your 18 years studying things that people said you need to learn. Finally you start doing more and more things that you want to do. Learning what you think is interesting and working with what you love.
I&amp;rsquo;m entering in a new phase of my life.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in a few projects that made most of my days goes by in a blink of an eye. Which is something that would make most of us really happy.
But it was recently that I felt a different kind of happiness with my work.
I was studying how Grilo works to use it in small project of mine.
Out of curiosity, I began to have more interest in how exactly Grilo works and the features that were expected to its future. It was about time to GSoC period start and I felt quite comfortable at seeking guidance with Grilo developers to share my will to help.
A little more than a month since my first contact with the community and I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to make some code reach upstream a plugin but&amp;hellip; what amazing experience this has been!
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know Magnatune until Juan introducing it to me. It&amp;rsquo;s really nice (check it out).
Even if some audio players have already a good Magnatune plugin (like Rhythmbox), the plugin I&amp;rsquo;m working on could be useful for others applications that may be integrated with Grilo.
The feeling of usefulness that I rarely felt with others projects I have worked, I found after this time I&amp;rsquo;ve spent with Grilo.
I&amp;rsquo;m really excited with all this. I&amp;rsquo;m learning a lot and I truly believe that I can help a lot more.
Step by step, giving back to the community what I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for so many years!
