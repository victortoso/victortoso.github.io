<p>First of all, hello everybody from Planet Gnome! This is the first post
that will take place there. It is a really nice community where I&rsquo;ve
been learning always something new from the past 5 months. I hope I can
put some interesting hacks for you guys.</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/AlbertoRuiz">Alberto Ruiz</a> for
including me.</p>

<p>I was
<a href="http://www.victortoso.com/magnatune-upstream-and-gsoc.html">accepted</a>
in GSoC this year to be working with
<a href="https://live.gnome.org/Grilo">Grilo</a>. It is a really nice project which
I&rsquo;m always having some fun while coding. I&rsquo;m being mentored by <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/JuanSuarez">Juan
Suarez</a> who has been always helpful
with my problems.</p>

<p>Grilo is basically a framework to get content through plugins. A lot of
plugins were made already and all were written in C. My GSoC project is
about making possible to write plugins in <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>.</p>

<p>About the project itself, I&rsquo;ll be writing a glue-code between Grilo and
Lua. They&rsquo;ll be tagged as lua-factory as the c code dealing with lua;
and grilo-library as a library written in c to be used by the
lua-plugins.</p>

<p>I tried to make a simple design to represent how grilo and grilo-plugins
works now and where my code will take place.</p>

<p><img src="/images/1304-01-grilo-and-lua-factory.png" alt="Design of Grilo + Grilo Plugins with Lua-Factory and Lua sources" /></p>

<p>The &lsquo;search&rsquo; is one of the subset commands that Grilo can request.</p>

<p>The progress in the moment I&rsquo;m writing this post is that the lyric
plugin get the content (by &lsquo;search&rsquo; and &lsquo;browse&rsquo;) and I&rsquo;m able to load
the plugin with my current lua-factory but can&rsquo;t perform any command
yet.</p>

<p>I guest this is it about GSoC for now :)</p>

<p>I would also like to say to those who followed me here, we have at least
three Brazilians interns in GNOME this year: <a href="https://15experience.wordpress.com/">Rafael
Fonseca</a>, <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/MelissaWen">Melissa
Wen</a> and myself. Brazil is in such
crazy historical moment right now.</p>

<p>If you know absolute nothing about it please do :)</p>

<p>To finish this post, this beautiful GNOME cup that my girlfriend gave to
me in my birthday.</p>
