      <description>GUADEC 2014 took place in Strasbourg, France and that was my first time in this beautiful country. My friend Watson Sato was also enrolled in the GSoC on GNOME and we were able to travel and attend the conference together.
The time slot per intern for the light talk was very short once again but everybody was able to summarize their work very well. Sadly the video was not uploaded.</description>

      <description>Brno is amazing. Just amazing. The people from here try to be helpfull even if they don&amp;rsquo;t speak a single word in English. The food is really good and quite cheap and the city is beautiful! I&amp;rsquo;m glad that I still have time for another tour around!
Well, travelling without many concerns, meeting amazing people and with the opportunity to learn things you love&amp;hellip; GUADEC has been an amazing experience.</description>

      <description>GUADEC 2013 was hosted in Brno, Czech Republic and it was my first time doing a talk for a big audience, quite an experience! I can see how nervous I got in the two minutes I had for the interns lightning talk.
Not super instructive video to watch but quite funny to me :)
Also, It is very interesting that a little bit more then a year later, I would be moving to Brno to start a new phase of my life.</description>
