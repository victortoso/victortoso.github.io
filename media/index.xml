This was the third time I&amp;rsquo;ve read it. This concept of redoing things is something I can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of, combined with science fiction and a little bit of mechas makes this manga a pure blast.</description></item><item><title>Alice in Borderland</title><link>https://victortoso.com/media/alice-in-borderland/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victortoso.com/media/alice-in-borderland/</guid><description>Watched the second season. A little disappointed, not as good as the first one. I may read the actual manga one day but not on top of my list.</description></item><item><title>The Recruit</title><link>https://victortoso.com/media/the-recruit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victortoso.com/media/the-recruit/</guid><description>I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting much but the combination of spy and humor themes in the first two episodes hooked me in. I did not find it exceptional but still, looking forward for a second season.</description></item></channel></rss>
